Create github account  
Install github desktop (Had to install git, did it with default settings, probably don't need the github desktop then)  
Need R and R studio  
Open Github (server) and R studio  

Go to Github
Create new repository (The first time)  
Gets a github URL  

Go to R studio  
file --> new project --> Version control --> Git (add https://github.com/csapou/TestRstudioIntegration.git find it under clone or download) -->
add directory name (did it automatially) and subdirectory --> create project  
Is now connected to github. Now create an R script  
File --> New file --> R script --> add code --> save (can see it added in files)

To upload to github  
Tools --> version control --> commit --> Select all files --> add comment --> commit --> wait --> Push

The files should be at github (refresh)
